### Shield Hero
> - Levels up by standing still or blocking enemy bullets.
> - Each level grants an additional block.
> - Is needed to take the rest of the cards in the class.

### Fireball
> - Blocking shoots a fireball towards where you're currently aiming.
> - Leveling up increases the number of fireballs fired.
> - Fireballs are only launched with every other additional block that you have (essentially every +2 additional blocks results in 1 more launch).
> - Increasing bullet damage and speed affects fireball damage and speed.

### Blizzard
> - Blocking conjures a storm of ice in an area. Allies are not affected.
> - The ice storm deals a small amount of damage while slowing enemies as well. Additionally, if foes stay in the area long enough, they get frozen (stunned).
> - Like Fireball, another storm is only created on every other additional block.
> - Leveling up increases the radius by 25% and the damage by 50%.

### Electric Fury
> - Blocking surrounds you with a field of lightning, damaging foes inside of it and increasing your gun's damage.
> - Foes inside the field have a chance of being silenced and stunned.
> - Leveling up increases the duration, the stun and silence chances, and the damage of it along with the damage boost to your gun.
